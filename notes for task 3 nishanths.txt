The configuration of all these devices are usually

GPS - for location based applications, speed detection.
Gyro + Accelerometer - for crash detection, driving pattern detection.
2G/ 3G /4G Modem - for connecting it up to the Internet
Bluetooth - for control or configuration from a near range device.
OBD adapter - For reading Engine Fault Codes, Engine Rpm, Intake air temperature, Mass airflow sensor, Engine Coolant temperature etc.

mqtt



1)publish and subscribe
2)messgaes:

it is the info exchnaged btw devices .it is either a command or a data
device 1 publishes on a toipc
devicde 2 is subscribed to tha same topic
hence device 2 recieves messages from device 1

3)topics:

intrest for particular tmessages
specify where you want to publish

topic exampel: home/office/lamp

4)broker:

it gathers all the message
filters the message
sends it to all the subscribed clients
commonly used broker :MOSQUITTO(r-pi)
example2: mqtt.groov.com

wild card:
a)+/status  this wil get all topics with status as subtopics
b)worksop/#  this will get all the subtoics of workshop

secured port:8883
insecure port:1883

c)# this willmatch with everything possible


q5)sigfox:
sigfox ready module
the device is installed with this module and this will send info which is authenticated  using a private key(special for each device) 
there is a sigfox base station that recievse these messages.the base sation is connected to the internet and it would send the message it recieved to the cloud.from sigfox cloud it transfers into our cloud and from that we can react accordingly


how to get started with sigfox:
1)we need to be in the area of coverage

It’s easy to start your IoT project:

Find an existing solution or build your own one (these solutions and the partners you’ll need are referenced on the Sigfox Partner Network online platform).
Contact your local Sigfox Operator for Sigfox IoT connectivity service subscription.
